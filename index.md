With all the problems in the world—economic distress, natural disasters, war—why does World Orphans put so much emphasis on the orphan? To answer, imagine this...

Imagine a world faced with catastrophic issues, such as extreme poverty, disease, starvation, human trafficking, and the exploitation of child soldiers. At the core of those issues is one common link—the orphan. Currently, there are over 140 million orphans in the world . . . abandoned, neglected, and vulnerable.

In a world inundated with hypocrisy, people are constantly looking for something pure and faultless. James 1:27 reminds us that “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after the orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.”
